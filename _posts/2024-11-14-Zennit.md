<section id="Intro">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-100 mb-4"> Tired of Reddit's flashing ads and endless scrolling? Me too. </h1> 
  <p>As a fellow Redditor, I spend way too much time sifting through a sea of distractions to find the good stuff – the funny memes, the insightful discussions, the cat videos (it's Reddit, there are always cat videos). Enter **Zennit**, my attempt to build a Reddit experience that's actually enjoyable.</p>

    <p>Let's face it, Reddit's main site can be a bit overwhelming. All those bright colors, flashing ads, and endless lists – it's enough to make your brain explode. I, for one, just want to focus on the content and connect with the communities I love.</p>
