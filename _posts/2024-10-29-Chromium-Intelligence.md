  <p>The development of this extension was driven by the need for an efficient, integrated tool that could handle a wide range of text and image processing tasks without the need to switch between multiple applications or services. As a professional dealing with both textual and visual content on a daily basis, I recognized the potential for significant productivity gains through such a tool. <em>Plus I wanted to implement something like Apple Intelligence in my browser.</em></p>
